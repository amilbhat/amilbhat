## Goals

Welcome to my coding journey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently on a mission to expand my skills in both backend web development and machine learning. Here are the areas I'm diving into:

## MERN Stack

In addition to backend development and machine learning, I'm also diving into the MERN stack:

- **MongoDB**: As part of my backend goals, I'm integrating MongoDB into the MERN stack for a seamless full-stack development experience.
- **Express.js**: My expertise in Express.js is not only for standalone backend applications but also for building the server side of MERN stack applications.
- **React.js**: I'm honing my skills in React.js for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: Serving as the backbone of the MERN stack, Node.js is central to my full-stack development journey.

## Machine Learning and Deep Learning Goals

I'm thrilled to announce my new focus on machine learning and deep learning. This exciting field opens up endless possibilities, and I'm eager to explore and contribute to advancements in artificial intelligence.
